# Fable III Collectible Tracking Spreadsheet

## What this is
This spreadsheet is a practical, player‑friendly tool for tracking every major collectible in *Fable III*. It organizes Silver Keys, Gold Keys, Gnomes, and Books into clean, structured sheets with consistent columns and simple check‑off fields. Each entry includes region, sub‑area, item number, and a clear location description so you always know exactly where to look.

The goal is to give players an **organic way to track progress** as they explore. Whether you’re replaying the game, returning after years, or aiming for 100% completion, this sheet acts as a reliable companion you can update naturally as you play.

## What problem it solves
- Keeps all collectibles in one place instead of scattered across wikis and videos  
- Prevents missing items that are easy to overlook or permanently missable  
- Makes it simple to resume progress after long breaks  
- Lets players track completion at their own pace  
- Provides a clean, sortable list for each collectible type  
- Supports achievement hunters and completionists with a dependable reference

## Who this is for

- Completionists aiming for 100% without missing anything

## How to enable checkboxes (optional but recommended)
Excel does not support native checkbox fields, so if you want clickable checkboxes:

1. Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/  
2. Create a new spreadsheet  
3. Click **File → Open → Upload**  
4. Upload the downloaded `.xlsx` file  
5. For each sheet, select the **Done** column from row 2 downward  
6. Click **Insert → Checkbox**  
7. Repeat for all sheets  

This gives you proper checkboxes instead of manually typing TRUE/FALSE.
